	Udp NTP Client with DNS

	I updated the example code to use DNS resolution from the Arduino 1.0 IDE

	Basically tries to use the load-balanced NTP servers which are
	  "magically" returned from DNS queries on pool.ntp.org
	If DNS fails, fall back to the hardcoded IP address
	  for time.nist.gov

	This code is also in the public domain.
